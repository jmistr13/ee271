Lab 1
a)	Name: Jesse Mistr
b)	mux4_1 Circuit Explanation:
    mux4_1’s output appears to be storing 4 alternating off/on patterns starting with the largest length off/on (off for 8, on for 8) and getting smaller until off for 1 and on for 1. These are broken into counts of 16 each. I’m inclined to believe that it is storing the data for a 4 variable (16 bit) output. We can see this in the mux2s, with i00 alternating every 8 counts, i01 alternating every 4, i10 every 2, and i11 every other one.
c)	When the signal is TRUE, the LED lights up.
d)	When the switch is in the up position, the signal is TRUE.
e)	When the button is not pressed, the signal is TRUE.
Estimated hours: 4 hours (including installing software)
